# Task Tracker package

Task tracker allows you to create tasks inside Atom, manage files tracked for each task by replicating file tree for easier navigation. It also shows you git status of those files, along with all TODOs, FIXMEs and leftover console.logs in those files.

See screenshots for more info.
